OTP Verification System 🔐 | Python - Capstone Project
This project implements a One-Time Password (OTP) Verification System using Python. The system generates a secure 6-digit OTP and sends it to the user’s email for authentication. Users must enter the received OTP to gain access, ensuring an added layer of security.

Key Features
✅ OTP Generation: Secure, random 6-digit OTP creation.
✅ Email Integration: Simulates sending OTP to the user’s email.
✅ User Validation: Accepts and verifies the OTP input.
✅ Error Handling: Provides retry attempts for incorrect entries.
✅ Documentation & Test Cases: Ensures smooth execution and robustness.
✅ Optional: GUI implementation for an enhanced user experience.

Project Structure
📌 otp_verification.py – Main script implementing OTP verification.
📌 README.md – Documentation on functionality, dependencies, and setup.
📌 test_cases.py – Covers different OTP validation scenarios.

How It Works
1️⃣ User requests an OTP.
2️⃣ A 6-digit OTP is generated and sent via email.
3️⃣ The user enters the received OTP.
4️⃣ The system verifies the OTP and grants/denies access accordingly.

This project demonstrates core Python programming, error handling, and user authentication concepts, making it an excellent hands-on learning experience. 🚀
